# Underwater_Adventure
this project was made so I could practice making an inventory system for a survival game, I also added vehicles that you can enter to offer a 
different form of movement from just swimming, there are also sharks that can be shot and feature a gun that allows a zoomed view and a crosshair that hightlights
when you are looking at an enemy
